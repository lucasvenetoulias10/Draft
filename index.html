  <h1>OMG – A Quiz!</h1>
  <h4>The following table examines the three most interesting things that I have learned so far this year in CS Topics.</h4>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Subject</th>
        <th colspan="2">Brief Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>History of Internet</td>
        <td>It was really cool to read about the history and the development of the interent. Though it was not that in depth, I learned about a number of interesting features to the internet and was amazed at the amount that has changed in the Intenet in such a small period of time.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Web Browsers</td>
        <td>It was nice to get an abstract understanding of how web browsers function. I had never really understood how they worked, even from an abstract point of view, and so found it interesting.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTML Forms</td>
        <td>Though I am not using a form at the moment, it was cool to see some of the other user interface options for a webpage. I had not really been aware of all of the options that can be used for a webpage, and so seeing them outlined like that and seeing how they might work in HTML was pretty nice.</td>
